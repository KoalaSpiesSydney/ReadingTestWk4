<!-- ================= PART 1 ================= -->
<section>
  <h2>Part 1 – Studying Platypuses</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>1. A – insight</strong><br>
    <em>Explanation:</em> “The insight this gave her…” fits grammatically and semantically — it means deep understanding. The other options don’t convey the same meaning.</li>

    <li><strong>2. C – Contrary</strong><br>
    <em>Explanation:</em> The phrase “Contrary to popular belief” introduces contrast with what most people assume — this is a fixed expression.</li>

    <li><strong>3. C – avoid</strong><br>
    <em>Explanation:</em> “Avoid human contact” makes logical sense — it means to stay away from. Other verbs don’t fit collocationally.</li>

    <li><strong>4. B – denies</strong><br>
    <em>Explanation:</em> “She denies the long-held claim” means she rejects it as untrue. It’s the correct collocation for a “claim.”</li>

    <li><strong>5. A – illusions</strong><br>
    <em>Explanation:</em> The fixed expression “under no illusions” means to have a realistic view. “Illusions” is the only noun that fits naturally.</li>

    <li><strong>6. C – extend</strong><br>
    <em>Explanation:</em> “Does not extend beyond…” means it doesn’t go further than — grammatically and logically correct.</li>

    <li><strong>7. B – provided</strong><br>
    <em>Explanation:</em> “Has provided valuable opportunities” is the standard collocation — means to offer or supply something useful.</li>

    <li><strong>8. A – taught</strong><br>
    <em>Explanation:</em> “The project has taught her…” fits idiomatically and links to what she has learned through experience.</li>
  </ol>

<section>
  <h2>Part 2 – The True Cost of Style</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>0. C – Analytical but cautiously optimistic</strong><br>
    <em>Explanation:</em> The writer’s tone is thoughtful, acknowledging challenges but suggesting positive change is possible.</li>

    <li><strong>1. C – Sustainable fashion was initially underestimated but is now gaining importance</strong><br>
    <em>Explanation:</em> The paragraph contrasts early dismissal with its new significance, matching this summary.</li>

    <li><strong>2. B – The environmental and social damage outweighs the low prices</strong><br>
    <em>Explanation:</em> “The real cost is paid elsewhere” implies hidden harm — not financial but ecological and ethical.</li>

    <li><strong>3. A – Reducing waste through creative reuse</strong><br>
    <em>Explanation:</em> “Slow fashion” promotes using existing materials and upcycling — exactly this idea.</li>

    <li><strong>4. B – Consumers must take responsibility for their buying habits</strong><br>
    <em>Explanation:</em> The insider’s quote emphasizes personal accountability, not just brand promises.</li>

    <li><strong>5. A – It is declining as people become more aware of its impact</strong><br>
    <em>Explanation:</em> The paragraph shows fast fashion’s appeal fading due to awareness of exploitation and waste.</li>

    <li><strong>6. A – They are making a genuine effort to change the industry</strong><br>
    <em>Explanation:</em> Designers using new materials and methods are portrayed positively as innovators.</li>

    <li><strong>7. B – Consumers and companies share responsibility for sustainable change</strong><br>
    <em>Explanation:</em> The final paragraph links both groups together in the need for conscious action.</li>

    <li><strong>8. A – People must value creativity over consumption</strong><br>
    <em>Explanation:</em> “Redefine what success and self-expression look like” suggests prioritizing meaning and creativity, not buying.</li>
  </ol>

  <ol>

    <em>Explanation:</em> Example sentence provided in the question illustrating instinctive decision-making.</li>

    <li><strong>1. C – These habits once helped our ancestors act quickly under pressure, but today they often lead to snap judgments and costly mistakes.</strong><br>
    <em>Explanation:</em> Fits perfectly with “heuristics” — explains their origin and modern drawbacks.</li>

    <li><strong>2. D – Advertisers exploit this by appealing to our emotions rather than our logic, knowing that feelings often override facts.</strong><br>
    <em>Explanation:</em> Expands on emotion’s influence on decision-making and gives a real-world example.</li>

    <li><strong>3. A – As our energy drops, we often default to easier, less thoughtful options — from unhealthy meals to unnecessary online purchases.</strong><br>
    <em>Explanation:</em> Directly relates to “decision fatigue” — loss of willpower and impulsive behaviour.</li>

    <li><strong>4. E – Paradoxically, this abundance of choice can leave us feeling anxious and indecisive instead of free and empowered.</strong><br>
    <em>Explanation:</em> Concludes logically about the negative psychological effect of too much choice.</li>
