  <h2>The True Cost of Style</h2>

  <p>
    When sustainability first entered the fashion conversation, many dismissed it as a passing trend — a marketing slogan rather than a movement. Yet in recent years, the industry has faced growing scrutiny from activists and consumers who no longer equate style with excess. The old model — buying cheap, wearing briefly, discarding quickly — is beginning to feel as outdated as the shoulder pads of the 1980s.
  </p>

  <p>
    For a generation raised on instant access, the shift has been complex. Fast fashion’s appeal lies in its affordability and speed: the thrill of a new outfit at the tap of a screen. But as documentaries expose the environmental toll — polluted rivers, exploited workers, and mountains of waste — many shoppers are starting to question whether that bargain dress was ever truly a bargain. They are learning that the real cost is often paid elsewhere.
  </p>

  <p>
    Meanwhile, designers are rethinking what it means to be “new.” Upcycling, rental platforms, and slow fashion movements encourage creativity within limits — transforming what already exists rather than endlessly producing more. Some brands now track the carbon footprint of each garment, while others invest in biodegradable materials and digital fashion shows to reduce waste.
  </p>

  <p>
    Still, the path to sustainability is far from simple. As one industry insider notes, even the most ethical label leaves a footprint. “We can’t buy our way out of this crisis,” she says. “We can only consume more consciously.” For fashion to change, it’s not enough for brands to promise; consumers must also redefine what success and self-expression look like.
